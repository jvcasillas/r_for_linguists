## R as a calculator

Initially, this might not seem incredibly useful, but using R as a calculator 
gives you feel for how it works, and can be helpful later on if you need to 
perform some type of transformation on your data. 

Try some simple math:

Addition: 

```{r, r-calculator1, exercise=TRUE}
2 + 2
```

</br>

Square a value: 

```{r, r-calculator2, exercise=TRUE}
4^2
```

</br>

Order of operations: 

```{r, r-calculator3, exercise=TRUE}
(12 * 15) / 2
```

Calculate a z-score: 

- raw score = 40
- pop. mean = 48
- pop. sd = 4.8

```{r, r-calculator4, exercise=TRUE}
# (x-bar - pop. mean) / pop. sd
(40 - 48) / 4.8

```
