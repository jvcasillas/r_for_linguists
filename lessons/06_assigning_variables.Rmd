## Assigning variables

R uses objects. You must assign them using ```<-``` in order to store them in 
memory. You can them call them by typing the variable or calling ```print()```. 
Store the value '2' to the object 'x'


```{r, assignment}
x <- 2
```

```{r, assignment1, exercise=TRUE}
x <- 2
print(x)
```

You can now perform an operation on 'x'.

```{r, assignment2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "assignment"}
x + 4
```

Try one of your own

```{r, assignment3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "assignment"}

```

```{r, assignment3-hint}
# Type in the variable 'x' and then add, subtract, multiple or divide it by 
# another number
```

If you assign another value to 'x', then the new value replaces the old one. 
Set 'x' to 30 and calculate the square root. 

```{r, assignment4, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r, assignment4-hint-1}
# Remember that ```<-``` is the assignment operator  
# Use ```sqrt()``` to calculate the square root
```



```{r, assignment4-hint-2}
x <- 30
sqrt(x)
```
