## Intro

This is a tutorial in R made for beginners. Use the menu to navigate to a 
section that you would like to practice, or move from topic to topic in a 
linear fashion as if you were reading a book. 

To get the most out of these exercises, run the code in the ```You try...``` 
sections from your browser. Complete the questions and check your answers using 
the ```Hint``` and ```Solutions``` boxes. 

This is a work in process. If you have questions, comments, or find any errors 
you can [contact me][email] or submit a [pull request][github]. Click
