## Comments

In R, anything that comes after \# is considered a comment. Comments are 
important because they help you to remember what you did, why you did 
it, etc. Add 2 + 2 and create a relevant comment:

```{r, comment-code, exercise=TRUE}
#############################
# Always comment your code! #
#############################

# This is a comment
2 + 2
```
