## Install packages

Packages can be installed from RStudio using the 'Packages' tab 
(normally in the bottom right window). Search for the package you want 
and hit `enter`. You can *manually* install packages from the console 
using the `install.packages()` function. Ex. 
`install.packages('devtools')`.
