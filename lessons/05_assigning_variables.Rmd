## Assigning variables

R uses objects. You must assign them using ```<-``` in order 
to store them in memory. You can them call them by typing 
the variable or calling ```print()```. Store the value '2' 
to the object 'x'

```{r, assignment, exercise=TRUE}

x <- 2
print(x)

# Perform an operation on 'x'
x + 4
```
